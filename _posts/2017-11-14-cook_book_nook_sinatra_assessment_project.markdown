For this assessment I was required to build an MVC (model-view-controller) Sinatra Application, that would incorporate CRUD (create-read-update-delete) functions. I have decided to build an app called “Cook Book Nook” for sharing the recipes online.

The front page invites existing users to log in or new guests to sign up. After logging into the app, the user is redirected to the main page, where a list of all existing recipes can be found:

The page for creating a new recipe renders a form, that includes fields for a recipe’s name, ingredients, and cooking instructions. Users also have the option of uploading an image of the meal:

Users can edit or delete recipes; however, these actions are obviously only available for their own recipes.

This is a pretty simple app, and one can think of lots of other features that can be added here, for instance, add recipes to favourites, rate them, create a separate section of the website for drinks and cocktails, etc. I hope to add these features as I return to this project in the future.
